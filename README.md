# password-generator

Gives the user an option to create a password or to test a password's strength.
Created password is 8 chars long, and should contain at least one number, one special character, and one upper/lower case character.
To test the strength, if it is less than 8 chars long, it is automatically invalid.
If it meets the first requirement and has he required characters, then it is strong, otherwise it is weak.

Uses TKinter for the GUI. Possibly should look into other GUI libraries.
